Brief explanation: 
This program is a multithreaded web server. 
We are creating dispatcher, which act like the "producer", and worker threads which act like the "consumer". 
As the server gets requests, the dispatcher places them in a bounded buffer for the worker threads to access. 
The requested file is logged and sent back to the server.
